# Synchronized Bathroom

Repository with the work of the second unit of the competition discipline at UFRN.

## About

This project implements a solution to the
well-known [producer-consumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer–consumer_problem) problem using synchronized
methods in bathroom scenary. In the Java programming language, synchronized methods concretize the idea of monitors to allow for the
execution of methods by concurrent threads in mutual exclusion. These threads are also condition-synchronized: they can
be suspended or notified for resuming execution under certain conditions.
